    #### Description:
    This program simulates a dashboard (such as the Desktop of a pc or the "home screen" of a mobile).
    It prompts the user to choose between 3 apps available to use.
    App 1: a mini-simplified version of Tetris
    App 2: budget manager
    App 3: recursive pattern drawing

    The program terminates if the user uses Ctrl-D
    If the choice is not 1, 2 or 3, the user is re-promoted.

    *****TETRIS:
    Each block can be moved left, right, down
    the user can quite the game with "q"
    mechanism to win/loose:

    ****BUDGET MANAGER:
    Asks for a monthly amount(monthly income) and a current status (student/worker/retired)
    the aim is to provide a recommended partition of the monthky budget, considering the current status (ex: a student will probably save more than a retired person).
    if the amount is quite low or high, there are further adjustments to make sure basic needs are met and to avoid excessive amounts allocated in a category.

    *******RECURSIVE DRAW
    the user is prompted to choose a symbol between ".", "*", "_" and a number between 1 and 10.
    the program draws a pattern using recursion, where the number is the height and the symbol the basic unit of the pattern
